              The inspiration for this project came out of a discussion concerning the fate of small-scale
            businesses post the COVID-19 pandemic. The question in focus was in connection to how small businesses were going to bounce back from such a hit to their daily livestyles and business routines. We realized there were several funding opportunities that were springing up specifically for businesses of different criteria that had been hit by this deadly pandemic. So we set course to look for opportunities that may be available for business owners to be able to gain some support to recover from this hit. Let's face the fact - how many small scale business owners out there might be well-aware of all of these available funds that they could potentially be able to get to help them rebuild? Trying to find such resources could take a lot of time!

        <div class="col-lg-4 mr-auto">
          <p class="lead">That is when our simple app comes in - a one-stop hub to connect business owners to the necessary funds for business rebuild! This way they can spend time saving their business than potentially ending up in awild goose chase. This simple web app is to assist small business owners with searching for funding oportunities that they stand a better chance of getting awarded some money to save their businesses and keep food on their families' tables. For non business owners, we have also gathered a couple of vital fundraising campaigns that you can donate to in an effort to assist these businesses as well as individuals in their recovery from the heavy blow of this pandemic. Do not forget that we have extra resources as well that are worth checking out. Kindly pass this on to the next business owner or friend!
